<h2>Atete</h2>

<p>A personal dashboard I made for my raspberry to quickly access my self-hosted apps</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtat314/atete/main/docs/cover1.png">

<p>It is inspired by various posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/" target="_blank">r/selfhosted</a></p>

<h4>Warning</h4>

<p>This project is NOT finished. It is by no means fully functioning. At no point it should be accessible over the public internet since there are no validation and security mechanisms. It also has no mobile design yet.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>The dashboard uses php server side, so it requires an Apache Server and a working php interpreter. It is also implied that it runs on a Linux environment. If you want to display the system's temperature, you also have to install <a href="https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors" target="_blank">lm-sensors</a></p>

<p>The icons used here are from <a href="https://iconmonstr.com/" target="_blank">iconmonstr</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable" target="_blank">Sortable</a> is also used in the Settings section</p>
